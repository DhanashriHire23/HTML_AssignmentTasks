    <p>Devkund Waterfall is located in Bhira Patnus and since it went viral on social media, it has become extremely crowded and dangerous place. Several lives have been lost while amateurs try to visit this place on their own. It is the confluence of three waterfalls and is said to be the origin of Kundalika River. It is about a three-hour trek from base village along the dam backwater and through forest to reach this place known as ‘Devkund’. A major part of the trek goes through some semi-dried forests with the river running parallel and sometimes crisscrossing through the route. A guide is required to be taken during the trek as there is dense forest around. According to the locals, the best period to visit this location is between September to mid Novembe</p>
